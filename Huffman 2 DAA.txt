"""
Explanation:

This code implements the Huffman Encoding Algorithm, which is used for lossless data compression. The algorithm assigns variable-length codes to characters based on their frequencies, with more frequent characters getting shorter codes.

Key components:
1. MinHeapNode: Represents a node in the Huffman tree, containing character data, frequency, and left/right child nodes.
2. HuffmanCoding: Contains static methods for building the Huffman tree and printing the codes.
3. huffman_code: Builds the Huffman tree using a min-heap and generates the codes.
4. print_codes: Recursively traverses the Huffman tree to print the codes for each character.

Example Input:
data = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
freq = [23, 12, 34, 10]

Example Output:
C: 0
D: 100
A: 101
B: 111

The output shows the Huffman codes assigned to each character based on their frequencies.

Space Complexity:
O(n), where n is the number of unique characters. The space is used to store the min-heap and the Huffman tree.

Time Complexity:
O(n log n), where n is the number of unique characters.
- Building the initial min-heap: O(n)
- Main loop (creating the Huffman tree): O(n log n), as we perform n-1 extract-min and insert operations on the heap
- Printing the codes: O(n), as we traverse each node once

The dominant factor is the main loop, so the overall time complexity is O(n log n).
